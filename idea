I want to improve this project in the design aspect later when I have more knowledge in this department.
One design idea:
I want to desing the page with minimalistic design

Another design idea:
Write the recipie in a 'cooking coding language' with variables and methods and stuff
and then design the web page as if we're in an IDE: with differnt colors and dark background for instance

Later when I learn how to interact with client, I can make them write codes in the language and see if they do the steps in the right order
if not, then a message will be displayed as to why this doesn't work
